Note:
<br/>
1. This project is built with Qt 5.x and OpenGL.
<br/>
2. This is a Visual Studio 2010 project, but you can easily port it to a Qt project by manually creating a .pro configuration file.
<br/>
3. If you use Visual Studio, you need Qt Visual Studio Add-in.
<br/>
4. You also need Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
<br/>
5. Good luck!
